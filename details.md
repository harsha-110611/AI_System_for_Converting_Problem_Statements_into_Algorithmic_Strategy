Algorithmic Strategy Generation System (ASGS)
Detailed System Design, Implementation, and Deployment Document

==================================================

1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed explanation of HOW the Algorithmic Strategy Generation System (ASGS) is designed, implemented, deployed, and maintained.

While requirements.md explains WHAT the system is expected to do, this file explains:
- How the system is structured internally
- How each module works
- How the system is deployed on AWS
- How teammates should run and maintain the project
- How failures are handled
- How the system can be extended in the future

This document acts as a single source of truth for implementation and operational understanding.

==================================================

2. Overall System Philosophy

ASGS is built around a single core idea:

Correct algorithmic thinking happens BEFORE coding.

Therefore:
- No executable solutions are generated
- No trial-and-error execution exists
- All decisions are made using reasoning, constraints, and patterns
- Explanations are treated as first-class outputs

The system behaves like an expert mentor that explains algorithm choice step by step.

==================================================

3. High-Level Architecture Description

The ASGS system follows a backend-only, modular architecture.

Logical request flow:

User submits problem statement  
→ Input Validation  
→ Natural Language Understanding  
→ Problem Abstraction  
→ Pattern Identification  
→ Feasibility Analysis  
→ Strategy Selection  
→ Failure Analysis  
→ Explanation Generation  
→ Structured Response  

Cloud deployment mapping:

Client (Browser / API Client)  
→ AWS EC2 Instance  
→ FastAPI Application  
→ ASGS Reasoning Engine  
→ S3 (Knowledge Base, Logs)  
→ CloudWatch (Monitoring)

==================================================

4. Detailed Module-Level Design

4.1 Input Handling Module

Responsibilities:
- Receive plain English problem statements
- Validate input length and format
- Reject empty or meaningless inputs
- Forward clean input to NLU module

Why this module exists:
This prevents garbage input from corrupting the reasoning pipeline.

--------------------------------------------------

4.2 Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Module

Responsibilities:
- Identify entities such as arrays, graphs, strings, trees
- Detect actions such as maximize, minimize, count, find
- Extract constraints like n ≤ 10^5, time limits, memory limits
- Normalize the problem into a canonical internal format

Output:
A structured abstraction of the problem, not raw text.

--------------------------------------------------

4.3 Problem Abstraction Module

Responsibilities:
- Convert extracted features into a generalized problem model
- Remove unnecessary narrative details
- Preserve only algorithm-relevant information

Example abstractions include:
- Contiguous vs non-contiguous
- Static vs dynamic constraints
- Single-pass vs multi-pass requirements

--------------------------------------------------

4.4 Problem Pattern Identification Module

Responsibilities:
- Match abstracted problem features with known algorithmic patterns
- Use rule-based mapping rather than keyword matching
- Produce a list of candidate strategies

Examples of patterns:
- Sliding window
- Two pointers
- Binary search
- Dynamic programming
- Greedy
- Graph traversal

--------------------------------------------------

4.5 Constraint-Based Feasibility Analysis Module

Responsibilities:
- Evaluate each candidate strategy against constraints
- Reject approaches that exceed time or space limits
- Ensure scalability for worst-case inputs

Key principle:
An algorithm that works logically but fails under constraints is treated as invalid.

--------------------------------------------------

4.6 Algorithm Strategy Selection Module

Responsibilities:
- Rank feasible strategies based on suitability
- Select exactly ONE optimal strategy
- Prepare structured justification for selection

This module enforces decisiveness and prevents ambiguity.

--------------------------------------------------

4.7 Failure Analysis Module

Responsibilities:
- Identify common incorrect or naive approaches
- Explain why humans are tempted to choose them
- Explain precisely why they fail under constraints

This module is critical for learning and evaluation.

--------------------------------------------------

4.8 Explanation Generation Module

Responsibilities:
- Combine outputs from all previous modules
- Generate human-readable explanation
- Maintain consistent explanation structure
- Report time and space complexity clearly

This is the final user-facing output.

==================================================

5. Detailed Development Procedure

5.1 Step 1: Repository Initialization

- Create GitHub repository

--------------------------------------------------

5.2 Step 2: Knowledge Base Construction

- List standard algorithmic paradigms
- Define properties of each algorithm
- Store time and space complexity information

--------------------------------------------------

5.3 Step 3: Reasoning Pipeline Implementation

- Implement modules independently
- Ensure loose coupling between modules
- Validate deterministic behavior
- Add internal logging for reasoning steps

--------------------------------------------------

5.4 Step 4: API Layer Implementation

14. Final Notes

This document explains HOW ASGS works end-to-end.
requirements.md explains WHAT ASGS requires.
Both documents must evolve together.
Any deviation must be documented explicitly.
