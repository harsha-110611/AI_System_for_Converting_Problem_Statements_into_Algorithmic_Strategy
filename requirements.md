Algorithmic Strategy Generation System (ASGS)
Detailed Requirements Specification Document

--------------------------------------------------

1. Project Identification

1.1 Project Name  
Algorithmic Strategy Generation System (ASGS)

1.2 Project Type  
AI-based reasoning and decision-support system for algorithmic problem solving.

1.3 Project Description  
ASGS is a system designed to analyze natural language programming problem statements and produce a structured explanation of the algorithmic strategy required to solve them.

Instead of generating executable code, the system focuses on explaining:
- Which algorithmic approach should be used
- Why that approach is correct
- Why other common approaches fail
- How constraints influence algorithm choice

This project emphasizes thinking before coding, which is a critical skill in software engineering, competitive programming, and technical interviews.

--------------------------------------------------

2. Purpose of the Requirements Document

The purpose of this requirements.md file is to clearly define WHAT the system needs in order to:
- Be understood by new contributors
- Be set up correctly
- Be evaluated objectively
- Avoid ambiguity and scope creep

This document does NOT explain how the system is implemented or deployed.  
All procedural and deployment-related details are documented separately in details.md.

--------------------------------------------------

3. Problem Motivation

In many programming scenarios, the hardest part is not writing code but:
- Understanding the problem correctly
- Identifying the right algorithm
- Avoiding inefficient or incorrect strategies

Most tools and learning resources either jump directly to code or provide solutions without explaining the reasoning.

ASGS addresses this gap by making algorithmic reasoning explicit, structured, and explainable.

--------------------------------------------------

4. System Scope

4.1 In-Scope Features

The system SHALL support the following:
- Acceptance of plain English programming problem statements
- Identification of key entities (arrays, graphs, trees, strings, etc.)
- Extraction of objectives (maximize, minimize, count, find existence)
- Detection and interpretation of constraints
- Classification into known algorithmic problem patterns
- Constraint-based elimination of infeasible approaches
- Selection of exactly one optimal algorithmic strategy
- Explanation of why the selected strategy works
- Explanation of why alternative strategies fail
- Reporting of time and space complexity
- Generation of structured, readable explanations

4.2 Out-of-Scope Features

The system SHALL NOT:
- Generate executable code or full implementations
